## [](#header-1) Pre-wedding drinks
Friday evening, 24th August 2018, Location TBC.

For those who can make to Vilnius early, we will be hosting a few drinks in Vilnius. It will be a great opportunity to meet and catch up with fellow wedding guests. Hope you see you there!

# [](#header-1) The ceremony
Join us for the ceremony, 1:00PM at Vilnius Town Hall, Didzioji str 31, Vilnius 01128, Lithuania

Please arrive 15-20 minutes before to have enough time to say hello to everyone and find your way to the ceremony hall.

Following the ceremony, please join us for a glass of bubbles in the townhall.

## [](#header-1) Flowers
No one can argue - they are beautiful and we love flowers. But they only last so long…  So don't worry about them, save time in the flower shop and instead get extra half an hour of sleep! We would rather you last longer during the party!
 
## [](#header-1) Gifts
Things wear and break, but memories last a lifetime! The greatest gift would be to have you celebrating our BIG day together and creating most beautiful memories which will make us smile for many years! If you would like to pamper us, we would be grateful if you could help us fund our dream honeymoon in Tanzania! We are planning to climb Kilimanjaro, explore African savanna in Ruaha national park and relax on the turquoise Indian ocean shores in Zanzibar.

## [](#header-1) What to wear
Feel free to dress in whatever makes you comfortable. For example, a dress shirt and khakis, or a day dress and sweater would be lovely.

After the ceremony we will be heading to the farm. Depending on the weather the ground might be soft and if it rains it will be muddy too:) Check the weather closer to the day, but keep in mind that the nights tend to get a bit cold, so you might want to bring something to throw on when the sun goes down!

Also have something comfortable and casual for the second day - it can be as chilled or as active as you want it to be so dress for that!

# [](#header-1) The party
The official part will finish at 2:00PM and everyone will be heading to the Smotiskio farm for the big celebration and overnight stay. The party will start from 4:00PM, but you are welcome to get there early, to check out the farm, the sheep, the horses, and the fields!

You can also use this time to set yourself up in your home for the night, whether this is a barn or a tent ;)

# [](#header-1) Logistics and Practicalities

### [](#header-3) Flights
For those coming from abroad, we suggest flying to Vilnius Airport as this is where arrival drinks and wedding ceremony will happen. You can also explore our beautiful capital :)

### [](#header-3) Airport transfers
Vilnius airport is only 15km away from Vilnius downtown. There is a train connecting airport and the central station, but an easier option is to take a taxi. Just don't take the taxi standing in front of airport building, these are official airport taxis, but their rates are double than normal taxi. Download one of the taxi apps: Uber, Taxify, etaksi. Taxi from the airport to downtown Vilnius should cost about 10-15 EUR.

### [](#header-3) Accommodation in Vilnius
We recommend staying in the old town 'Senamiestis' or 'Uzupis' districts – these are at the heart of Vilnius and you can walk everywhere by foot. There is a range of hotels and Airbnb from 30 to 100EUR p/n depending on what you are looking for. Let us know if you have any questions or need help with accommodation ;)
