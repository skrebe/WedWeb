# [](#header-1) Logistics and Practicalities

### [](#header-3) Flights

For those coming from abroad, we suggest flying to Vilnius Airport as this is where arrival drinks and wedding ceremony will happen. You can also explore our beautiful capital :)

### [](#header-3) Airport transfers

Vilnius airport is only 15km away from Vilnius downtown. There is a train connecting airport and the central station, but an easier option is to take a taxi. Just don't take the taxi standing in front of airport building, these are official airport taxis, but their rates are double than normal taxi. Download one of the taxi apps: Uber, Taxify, etaksi. Taxi from the airport to downtown Vilnius should cost about 10-15 EUR.

### [](#header-3) Accommodation in Vilnius

We recommend staying in the old town 'Senamiestis' or 'Uzupis' – these are at the heart of Vilnius and you can walk everywhere by foot. There is a range of hotels and Airbnb from 30 to 100EUR p/n depending on what you are looking for. Let us know if you have any questions or need help with accommodation ;)
