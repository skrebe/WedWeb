<h1 id="-logistics-and-practicalities"><a href="#header-1"></a> Logistics and Practicalities</h1>

<h3 id="-flights"><a href="#header-3"></a> Flights</h3>

<p>For those coming from abroad, we suggest flying to Vilnius Airport as this is where arrival drinks and wedding ceremony will happen. You can also explore our beautiful capital :)</p>

<h3 id="-airport-transfers"><a href="#header-3"></a> Airport transfers</h3>

<p>Vilnius airport is only 15km away from Vilnius downtown. There is a train connecting airport and the central station, but an easier option is to take a taxi. Just don’t take the taxi standing in front of airport building, these are official airport taxis, but their rates are double than normal taxi. Download one of the taxi apps: Uber, Taxify, etaksi. Taxi from the airport to downtown Vilnius should cost about 10-15 EUR.</p>

<h3 id="-accommodation-in-vilnius"><a href="#header-3"></a> Accommodation in Vilnius</h3>

<p>We recommend staying in the old town ‘Senamiestis’ or ‘Uzupis’ districts – these are at the heart of Vilnius and you can walk everywhere by foot. There is a range of hotels and Airbnb from 30 to 100EUR p/n depending on what you are looking for. Let us know if you have any questions or need help with accommodation ;)</p>
